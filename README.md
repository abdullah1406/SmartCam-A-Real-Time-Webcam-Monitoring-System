# Webcam Motion Detection System

## Project Overview

This project captures and processes real-time webcam footage using Python and OpenCV. Designed to run in Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible), the tool utilizes a live video feed for tasks such as motion detection, frame analysis, and basic computer vision operations.

It serves as a lightweight, interactive demonstration of webcam integration in Python-based environments, suitable for beginners exploring image and video processing.

## Features

* Access webcam and display images
* Capture individual frames
* Apply filters or processing on frames
* Designed to run in Google Colab (optional tweaks needed)
* Easily customizable for object detection or surveillance projects

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x  
* OpenCV (cv2)  
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
* NumPy (if used)

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook file (`s.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. If using Google Colab, enable webcam permission by running the code cell that uses `cv2.VideoCapture()` or `cv2_imshow()`.
3. Run each cell step-by-step.

> **Note**: In Google Colab, webcam access is limited. Use `cv2_imshow()` instead of `cv2.imshow()`.
